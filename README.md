# Am1st
Data used in my Am1st article co-authored with Dave Kopel. This data was also used in a separate paper which I wrote with Professor Youngsung Kim. That paper will hopefully be published in an academic journal. The full article also includes other models and robustness checks--this is just the most simple model used in that paper. All of them come to the same conclusion: permitless carry is not significantly associated with homicide rates. The paper with Kim does not analyze suicide rates.
