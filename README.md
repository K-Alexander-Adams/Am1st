# Am1st
Data used in my Am1st article co-authored with Dave Kopel. This data was also used in a seperate paper which I plan to publish with a different co-author, Professor Youngsung Kim, in an academic journal. The full article also includes other models and robustness checks--this is just the most simple model used in that paper. All of them come to the same conclusion: permitless carry is not significantly associated with homicide rates.
